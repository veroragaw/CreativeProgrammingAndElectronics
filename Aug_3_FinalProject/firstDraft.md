**August 2: Homework**

*First Draft-Final Project*


As I am very interested in architecture and I was very inspired by Daniel Rozin, I want to use Arduino to automate the opening and closing of a curtain. This would be achieved using a motor to pull the curtain cord, which will close the curtains at night or allow for light to enter the room. The way the motor will know to open or close the curtain will be through the photoresistor. If the photoresistor detects light, it will open the curtain but if the sun begins to set, the curtains will close. Since the first instance of light will open the curtains, the contraption could also act as an alarm clock through communication with Processing. When the photoresistor senses light, Processing will play an alarm and display an animation, waking the user up from their sleep. Once the user clicks a button, the music and animation will stop but the curtains will continue to be open. If for some reason the user wishes to close or open the curtains manually, a second switch will allow for this.


I will work on the curtains in my living room as they work with a cord that can be pulled by a motor in order to open the curtains and, to close it, an other motor must pull on an other cord. This will mean that both motors will be required as well as a photoresistor and two switches. Code to create the animation and trigger the sound will also be integrated into the project.
