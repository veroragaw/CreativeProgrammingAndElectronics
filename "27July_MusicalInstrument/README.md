*Musical Instrument*

My musical instrument consists of two switches. The blue switch controls the playing of a melody while the red switch controls the position of the servo. It allows you to create a unique song from the melody and the sound of the moving servo motor.


I had lots of trouble making the melody sound the way I wanted it to but after several tries, I achieved the sound I wanted.


I also had issues getting the speakers and the switch to communicate but then I realized I could include the && conditional to the if statement that made the melody play. I was also confused as to how to make the servo play without delay but I solved this by adding and subtracting the values of the position when a switch was pressed and released.

Here is a schematic demonstrating how the instrument works.
