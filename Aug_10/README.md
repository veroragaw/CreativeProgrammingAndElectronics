**August 10: Final**

*Process- Final Project*


As of now, I have set up the servo motor to turn on the light with the detection of a clap as long as the light sensor detects darkness in the room and I have also connected
the servo motor to a button which will allow the light to be manually turned on.


I am having problems getting the servo to move in the opposite direction but once I do achieve this, I will program the servo motor to turn off the light after it hears two claps
and the light sensor detects darkness in the room. I will then program the servo to turn off the light when the button I used previously is pressed.


If I have time, I want to incorporate Processing and play a soothing melody when the lights are off. I already wired a second switch to the Arduino which is meant to stop the
melody manually.


In short, I have:

1.Attached the arduino and bread board to the wall and set up the servo motor to turn on a light switch

2.Programmed the servo motor to turn on a light switch using a sound sensor that detects one clap and a photo resistor that detects darkness

3.Programmed the servo motor to turn on a light switch using a button

I still need to

1.Programm the servo motor to turn off a light switch using a sound sensor that detects two claps and a photo resistor that detects darkness

2.Program the servo motor to turn off a light switch using a button

3.Communicate Processing with Arduino to play a melody when the light is off using a sound sensor that detects two claps and a photo resistor that detects darkness
