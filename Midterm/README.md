**July 20: Midterm**

*Paddle Ball Game Pt2*

For the midterm, I updated my previous game, the Paddle Ball Game, to include audio and video. I also fixed some of the code, added text, and allowed the game to be restarted with the push of a button.

I had issues when determining how long the sounds would play, specifically for when the game was lost. To fix this, I created a counter which counted the frames and would stop the audio on the 10th frame.
