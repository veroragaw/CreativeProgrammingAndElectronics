**August 5: Homework**

*Second Draft-Final Project*


My previous interests in creating an automatic curtain using arduino has changed to a sensorized lamp switch. I found that an issue I always encounter is that when I go to
bed, the light switch of my room is near the door and after I turn off the lights, I have to walk in the dark for several steps. I have a bed-side lamp which ideally helps solve
this issue but it is at the opposite end of the room so I would have to enter the room, turn on the lamp, and then go turn off the main room light. My solution is to attach the motor
to the lamp switch in a way that, when instructed, it will flip the switch of my night lamp from the opposite end of the room.

I have begun researching past projects that deal with the motorization because I predict that will be the hardest part to arrange and I found various examples. I additionally
thought that if I want the lamp switch to be turned on with a clap, I will need a mic or some sort of sound sensor.

Since the toughest part will be the automation of the lamp switch, I will begin with this aspect and focus on the motor successfully switching the lamp switch on and off,
which is a challenge in itself as it will require a lot of inginuity. Once I have that set up, I will add the light sensor, which will instruct the motor to switch the lamp on
when it senses that the room light is off. Since I will not always want the lamp to be turned on if the room lights are off, I will also add a sound sensor. If the lights are off
and I clap, the motor will turn the lamp on. This will prevent any loud noises during the day or while the lights are on to turn the lamp on by accident.

When the lamp has been turned on, I will incorporate Processing to play a soothing sound and display an animation which will encourage sleep. The user can disable the sound and 
animation with the click of a button. A second button will also be added to turn off the lamp if for some reason the user wishes to turn off the lamp without making noise. This
is because I have a roommate and some times she goes to sleep before me but I keep the lamp on for reading.

Something not covered in class but I have considered is to have a connection between Arduino and my phone through bluetooth so that I could press a button on my phone and the 
motor would turn the lamp on or off. The element of the sound sensor has also not been covered in class but there are tutorials that teach how it works so I'm not too concerned 
about that aspect.
