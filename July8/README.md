**July 8: Homework**

*Self portrait*

This portrait, pictured below, depicts me next to an empty canvas and a palette with paint on it. I have always loved art and when choosing a major, I decided to pick architecture as I couldn't imagine my life without the creation of art. Although I don't usually have a lot of time to paint, I have recently been able to paint during the summer.

While creating the portrait, the hardest part was figuring out which x and y coordinates were the best. Since the axis aren't numerated, I had to try several x and y coordinate values until I reached the ones I wanted. An other issue I had was with the creation of arcs. I had to search online to see which combination of PI, HALF_PI, QUARTER_PI, etc. would achieve the shape of eyebrows and mouth I wanted. Figuring out the color I wanted was a challenge at first but upon searching color rgb, I successfully created the colors I wanted. The order of elements I created in the code was also to be considered as some times the shapes overlapped awkwardly. Other than that, I enjoyed the assignment as it was a way of painting.
