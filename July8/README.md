//Using what we've learned in Processing, create a simple self portrait of yourself in an environment that is meaningful to you. The purpose of this exercise is to practice what we've learned, and not to test your artistic skills, so it doesn't really matter how good it is.
The portrait must be entirely created by your code i.e. you must not interact with your computer while the portrait is being made (e.g. no drawing using the mouse)
The portrait does not need to be dynamic (i.e. it does not need to change while we look at it)
The portrait does not need to be realistic. The purpose is to practice using the simple drawing functions, and for us to get to know each other a little bit better.
In your Github repository, create a new folder named July 8
Upload your program into the new folder, with the extension .pde. Your program should be well commented and organized. If you use any variables, chose good names.
Upload a screenshot of your portrait into the new folder
Create a README.md in the new folder and include your screenshot in the README.md.
Describe what the environment is supposed to be and why it is important to you
Write a short description of any difficulties you had or anything interesting you discovered.
