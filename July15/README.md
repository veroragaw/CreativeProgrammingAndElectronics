*Paddle Ball Game*

In order to create this game, I first replicated the bouncing ball code. I then added the paddle board and set constraints so that the ball would bounce off the paddle.

I had some trouble making the ball not bounce off the bottom edge of the canvas and only off the top edge of the paddle and the sides of the canvas. However, I achieved this by discovering the && (and) element in the if() loop.

Something I wish I had done is created a count for the number of collisions between the ball and the rectangle. I couldn't do this because I had trouble defining a collision.
