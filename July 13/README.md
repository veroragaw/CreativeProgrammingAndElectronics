**July 13: Homework**

*Work of Art, medium: Loops*

As a native Venezuelan, I have always been exposed to [Carlos Cruz-Diez](https://www.cruzdiezartfoundation.org/carlos-cruz-diez)'s artwork. It has hung on my [walls](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/proxy/q7eBP8AJwIUHZ0j7gJ3oB38KEu3Ppv_hC66VyTQng2rWOSzTAdstykNzsKe6cPVDnsYl-CMB7h1XR-UDipGm3NjSySZOiIesi2p9tzKfAW0T8vEmC8k8Zhzvqmx4VIZCWUw0d-q3GCxBUuFc), been showcased in [museums](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/e3/39/cf/e339cf0da73816111c6c9835863cff4a.jpg) and along [highways](https://a4.pbase.com/o6/23/943723/1/141028553.GtYhDjFy.CarlosCruzDiezArtpiece-Caracas.jpg), and decorates the [airport](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/29/d7/b4/29d7b4bf2d5b35f17420abcd3a42ab73.jpg) of my city. When I travel, I see his influence in the [pedestrian crossing](https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.collageplatform.com.prod/image_cache/1010x580_fit/5ab12bb7a09a72340a8b4568/18b6026228e0ec20742a0a1517b13f76.jpg) design of Miami's streets and in countless museums internationally from London to Paris to New York to [Canada](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/582af06ce58c62e99d8b4f3a/1479666879196-71PUG6JCPKPOGW6825EH/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kDqzmzv8_EiZRaTaGlLEWr4UqsxRUqqbr1mOJYKfIPR7LoDQ9mXPOjoJoqy81S2I8N_N4V1vUb5AoIIIbLZhVYxCRW4BPu10St3TBAUQYVKcZt8J39GJS7xE16x286v5-APMAXFil5FsNKUqAg2DgyMaFhkJEtsNI_p-HZdFyJ4Q/Cruz-Diez_Caura_1_2015_lithograph_23-5x27-5_%2860x70cm%29.jpg?format=1000w). His incredible dizzyingly abstract work, which consists of rigid lines of color that swirl into one another, inspired me to create my generative work of art.
