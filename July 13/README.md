*Generative Work of Art, medium: XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXx*

As a native Venezuelan, I have always been exposed to [Carlos Cruz-Diez](https://www.cruzdiezartfoundation.org/carlos-cruz-diez)'s artwork. It has hung on my [walls](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/proxy/q7eBP8AJwIUHZ0j7gJ3oB38KEu3Ppv_hC66VyTQng2rWOSzTAdstykNzsKe6cPVDnsYl-CMB7h1XR-UDipGm3NjSySZOiIesi2p9tzKfAW0T8vEmC8k8Zhzvqmx4VIZCWUw0d-q3GCxBUuFc), been showcased in [museums](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/e3/39/cf/e339cf0da73816111c6c9835863cff4a.jpg) and along [highways](https://a4.pbase.com/o6/23/943723/1/141028553.GtYhDjFy.CarlosCruzDiezArtpiece-Caracas.jpg), and decorates the [airport](https://i.pinimg.com/originals/29/d7/b4/29d7b4bf2d5b35f17420abcd3a42ab73.jpg) of my city. When I travel, I see his influence in the [pedestrian crossing](https://s3.amazonaws.com/files.collageplatform.com.prod/image_cache/1010x580_fit/5ab12bb7a09a72340a8b4568/18b6026228e0ec20742a0a1517b13f76.jpg) design of Miami's streets and in countless museums internationally from [London to Paris to New York](https://www.rukajgallery.com/carlos-cruzdiez). His incredible dizzyingly abstract work, which consists of rigid lines of color that swirl into one another, inspired me to create my generative work of art.
