**July 13: Homework**

*Work of Art, medium: Loops*

As a native Venezuelan, I have always been exposed to Carlos Cruz-Diez's artwork. It has hung on my [walls](https://www.google.com/url?sa=i&url=http%3A%2F%2Fpuerta-roja.com%2Fart%2Fartists%2Fcarloscruzdiez%2F&psig=AOvVaw2d-3NKS3xr23pBhwhqS_4Z&ust=1594579413173000&source=images&cd=vfe&ved=0CAIQjRxqFwoTCJjBha7txeoCFQAAAAAdAAAAABAE), been showcased in museums and along highways, and decorates the airport of my city. When I travel, I see his influence in the pedestrian crossing design of Miami's streets and in countless museums internationally from London to Paris to New York. His incredible dizzyingly abstract work, which consists of rigid lines of color that swirl into one another, inspired me to create my generative work of art.
